## Project Motivation
The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has opened avenues for addressing critical social challenges, including emotional isolation and loneliness. In a world where people often feel disconnected despite being digitally connected, there is a rising need for innovative solutions that foster emotional support. Many individuals, especially those who live alone or face social challenges, may lack meaningful interactions, resulting in adverse effects on mental health. The motivation for this project arises from the potential of AI to act as a bridge in providing companionship to those in need. Unlike conventional chatbots that deliver transactional responses, a human-companion chatbot focuses on empathy and understanding. This aligns with the increasing demand for AI systems that can analyze emotions and adapt to user sentiments.

Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP), voice sentiment analysis, and transformer-based models like GPT have made it possible to create more human-like interactions. By leveraging these technologies, the project aims to develop a system capable of understanding not only what users say but also how they feel. This approach aspires to bring a level of emotional intelligence to AI systems that has been largely absent in existing solutions.

The project is also inspired by the societal need for accessible mental health support tools. By acting as a virtual companion, the chatbot can help individuals alleviate feelings of loneliness, provide a listening ear, and stimulate meaningful conversations. This motivation underpins the belief that AI, when designed thoughtfully, can contribute positively to mental and emotional wellbeing.

## Project Overview
The **Interactive Chatbot for Mental Wellbeing** combines a modern frontend built with TypeScript and React, a scalable Flask backend, and a PostgreSQL database to deliver a seamless user experience.

- **Machine Learning**: GPT-2 (fine-tuned), Transformers, PyTorch
- **Other Tools**: python-dotenv, psycopg2-binary

## Database Schema
The database is a cornerstone of this project, ensuring data persistence, user tracking, and interaction logging. Below is the schema derived from the `server.py` file, covering all four tables:

### 1. `UserAccount`
Stores user registration and authentication details.
- **user_id**: `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY` - Unique identifier for each user.
- **firstname**: `VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL` - User’s first name.
- **lastname**: `VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL` - User’s last name.
- **email**: `VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE` - User’s email (unique constraint).
- **password**: `VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL` - User’s password (stored as plain text in this implementation; consider hashing in production).
- **created_at**: `TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` - Account creation timestamp.
- **last_login**: `TIMESTAMP` - Last login timestamp (nullable).

**SQL Definition**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE UserAccount (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    firstname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    lastname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    last_login TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 2. `InteractionLog`
Logs all chatbot interactions for analysis and improvement.
- **interaction_id**: `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY` - Unique identifier for each interaction.
- **user_input**: `VARCHAR(500)` - User’s input to the chatbot.
- **llm_response**: `VARCHAR(500)` - Chatbot’s generated response.
- **user_id**: `INTEGER REFERENCES UserAccount(user_id)` - Foreign key linking to the user.

**SQL Definition**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE InteractionLog (
    interaction_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_input VARCHAR(500),
    llm_response VARCHAR(500),
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES UserAccount(user_id)
);
```

### 3. `Ratings`
Stores user ratings for the chatbot experience.
- **rating_id**: `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY` - Unique identifier for each rating.
- **rating**: `INTEGER NOT NULL` - Rating value (e.g., 1-5).
- **user_id**: `INTEGER REFERENCES UserAccount(user_id)` - Foreign key linking to the user.
- **created_at**: `TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` - Rating submission timestamp.

**SQL Definition**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Ratings (
    rating_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    rating INTEGER NOT NULL,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES UserAccount(user_id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 4. `Feedback`
Captures detailed user feedback for iterative improvements.
- **feedback_id**: `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY` - Unique identifier for each feedback entry.
- **feedback_message**: `TEXT NOT NULL` - User’s feedback text.
- **user_id**: `INTEGER REFERENCES UserAccount(user_id)` - Foreign key linking to the user.
- **created_at**: `TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` - Feedback submission timestamp.

**SQL Definition**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Feedback (
    feedback_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    feedback_message TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES UserAccount(user_id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Notes**:
- Foreign keys (`user_id`) ensure referential integrity between tables.
- The schema dynamically creates tables if they don’t exist, as implemented in `server.py`.
- Passwords should ideally be hashed (e.g., using `bcrypt`) for security in a production environment.
